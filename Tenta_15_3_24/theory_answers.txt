Problem 2:
Discussion: What is placement new? How is it different from new? When should it be
used.

Answer:
Placement new is a specialized version of new that constructs an object in 
preallocated memory rather than dynamically allocating memory. It is used 
when we want to control where an object is created.

Problem 4:
Discussion: Suppose we are iterating a container and whenever we find the value 0 we
insert another 0 at the beginning of the container, and insert 1 at the end. Name two con-
tainers that can be used to do this in-place (i.e. by directly modifying the container rather
than copying to a new one) without moving the previously existing elements in memory.
Explain why your chosen containers work, and explain why std::vector does not work.
It might be useful to look at this page: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container

Answer:
Deque and list (doubly linked list) can be used. These containers have pointers to first and
last objects and inserting new objects don't affect the memory location of the existing objects.
Vector doesn't work since it dynamically allocates memory to handle its element. When inserting
to the front, it shifts all the elements, which means they are moved in memory.
